# Virtualization
In this lab we will use QEMU and KVM to build virtual machines.
QEMU is a userland type 2 (i.e runs upon a host OS) hypervisor for performing hardware virtualization, allowing code written for a given processor to be executed on another (i.e ARM on x86, or PPC on ARM).
Though QEMU can run on its own and emulate all of the virtual machineâ€™s resources, as all the emulation is performed in software it is extremely slow.
KVM is a Linux kernel module.
It is a type 1 hypervisor that is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V).
But what is full virtualization, you may ask?
When a CPU is emulated (vCPU) by the hypervisor, the hypervisor has to translate the instructions meant for the vCPU to the physical CPU.
As you can imagine this has a massive performance impact.
To overcome this, modern processors support virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT-x and AMD-V.
These technologies provide the ability for a slice of the physical CPU to be directly mapped to the vCPU.
Therefore the instructions meant for the vCPU can be directly executed on the physical CPU slice.
